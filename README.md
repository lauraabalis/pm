# My Special Day

* This is a wedding-planning application.

* The user can utilize the application to create lists of items needed for a wedding. Lists will be housed in four categories.

* The user can add entries to each of the four lists. Once an item in a given list has been ordered, the user can click the checkbox next to that item to indicate placement of the order. If an issue with the order arises, the user can click the checkbox a second time to indicate that a new order needs to be placed.

* I used AngularJS, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to complete this project.
